## 1. Objective <a id=section1></a>

In this project I have generated catroon image using three different GANs. Later compared among three of this which is giving better result and even used the FID score for analysing.

To run this project you have to following libraries provided in section 2.

## 2. Importing Packages  <a id=section2></a>

To generate the cartoon images form the real images I have used the dataset from the kaggle website. And the link for the dataset is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/selfie2anime". 

To run this project you have to follow following steps,

1. Clone the repository (git clone "repository name"),
2. Upload the zip file of the dataset on the drive,
3. Open the google collaboratory,
4. Change the runtime to GPU for faster execution,
5. Mount the drive with colab,
6. Execute the code.

## Thank You
